# PAM (Personal Assistant Manager)

My final project for RefactorU. A conversational web app that, as of right now, can handle setting timers in seconds that was built
in a little over a week. I'm currently still working on it, trying to add more functionality like reminders and weather forecats,
while also improving the conversational AI aspect of it. Uses MEAN stack for front and back end, API AI, and Materialize CSS.
